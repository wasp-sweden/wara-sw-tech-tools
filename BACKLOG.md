# Backlog

## Tooling:
- Benchmarking Best Practices tool
  - [ ] B1 scan that no cron jobs are scheduled anywhere
  - [N] B2 no heavy BG processes running
  - [ ] B3 no GUI running
  - [ ] B4 CPU frequency governor set to fixed frequency or turboboost disabled
  + [N] B5 hyperthreading disabled
- [ ] Update Dynamic Best practices tool: auto-fix [B1] if possible
- [ ] Update Dynamic Best practices tool: auto-fix [B4] if possible (max frequency)
+ [N] Update Dynamic Best practices tool: auto-fix [B5] if possible
- [ ] Command-line tool "for dummies" who want to run OVE on the ERDC:
  - Script to check/install cloud access setup on client (ask for everything)
  - Spin up ERDC image, run benchmark or test on ERDC, transfer results, shut down image

## Milestone X: end-to-end demonstrator example
+ [AN] Pre-built Docker images
+ [N] build a basic dashboard application
- [] depclean
     + [N] make depclean run and produce output
     + [N] create depclean test dashboard
     - [] show some actually useful information on dashboard
     - [] make dashboard aesthetically pleasing
- [] record results in some structured manner
     + [N] directory structure
     - [N] metadata
     - [] handle different formats in some unified way (SARIF is nice but probably doesn't work for everything)
- [] package + description: how to build a demonstrator for your tool (consider container image?)
- [] figure out how to maintain some kind of separation between tools and corpus
     - [] repo directory structure

## Milestone Y: scale to breadth and fix all bugs that are in the way (more C/C++ corpus projects and tools)
- discuss what formats to use for different kinds of tools (see above)
- prestudy for dynamic tools in next Milestone

## Miscellaneous
- [] fix cassandra patch issue in some better way
