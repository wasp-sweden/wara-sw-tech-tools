# WARA-SW: Software Corpus and Offline Tool Evaluation Platform

Aim: Make it easy to evaluate (offline) software tools on existing
Open Source software, with a foucs on software used in the Swedish
industry.

This repository will provide a collection of Open Source projects (via git references), plus infrastructure for evaluating offline software tools on that software.
Tools intended for evaluation include:
- static checkers
- compilers
- (more to come)

This repository is part of the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and
Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/), specifically the
WASP [Research Arena for Software
(WARA-SW)](https://wasp-sweden.org/research/research-arenas/wara-sw/).

# Requirements
- Mainstream Linux distribution
- `bash`
- Most packages require compilers or run-time systems; OVE (see below) will report system dependencies as needed.

This repository uses [OVE](https://github.com/Ericsson/ove).

# Installing and running
tbd (TODO: include a quick-start one-liner analogous to the OVE tutorial one)

# Backlog
See the [Backlog](https://github.com/wasp-sweden/wara-sw-tech-tools/blob/main/README.md) file for details.
